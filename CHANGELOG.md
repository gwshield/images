## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- PHP hardened image (FPM profile — target version TBD)
- Go builder v1.26 (compile-only + dev variants)
- Hub → pipeline request promotion workflow (vote threshold definition + issue template)
- MCP server exposing container hardening patterns to AI tools
- `check-stage` and `check-prod` devbox run scripts (still stubs)

---

## [v0.3.5-alpha] — 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **`nats:v2.12.5` functional test**: `/healthz` startup timeout resolved — `sleep 3` → `sleep 8`
- **`postgres:v15.17-cli` + `v17.9-cli` wrong image content**: silent `:main` fallback in
  `release-public.yml` caused the wrong image to be promoted when the version tag was absent
  in the private registry; replaced with a hard-fail and actionable error message; both images
  re-promoted with correct content

### Added

- **Post-promote smoke tests** for all 43 images: every `promote.yml` run now executes the
  image-specific `smoke.sh` against the published `ghcr.io/gwshield` image and writes results
  to the Hub `smoke_results` table (accessible via the security detail page and catalog badge)
- **`scripts/make_smoke_result.py`**: helper that parses `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` lines from smoke
  output into structured `smoke-result.json`
- **`images/*/tests/smoke.sh`**: smoke scripts for all 43 runtime + builder images added to
  this repository; parametrised via `$1 IMAGE`

---

## [v0.3.1-alpha] — 2026-03-14

### Changed

#### Hub metadata: image size display corrected

`Image size` on the hub detail page now shows the correct compressed transfer size
(sum of OCI layer blobs) for all 43 images. `Runnable size` is no longer displayed —
the OCI registry API does not expose uncompressed layer sizes without pulling the full image,
so displaying an estimated or duplicated value would be misleading. The field is hidden when
no value is available.

---

## [v0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-03-14

### Added

#### OTel Collector Contrib v0.147.0

Pre-built upstream binary in a distroless/static base. Fully static, zero dynamic
dependencies. All receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions from
`opentelemetry-collector-contrib` included.

| Profile | Image | CVEs |
|---|---|---|
| contrib | `ghcr.io/gwshield/otelcol:v0.147.0` | 0 |

- EXPOSE 4317/tcp (OTLP gRPC), 4318/tcp (OTLP HTTP), 8888/tcp (Prometheus metrics), 13133/tcp (health)
- Bundled config with `health_check` extension enabled
- SHA256-verified binary — no source compilation required

#### NATS Server v2.12.5 — standard profile

Pre-built upstream binary in a distroless/static base. Fully static, zero dynamic
dependencies. JetStream persistence enabled.

| Profile | Image | CVEs |
|---|---|---|
| standard | `ghcr.io/gwshield/nats:v2.12.5` | 0 |

- EXPOSE 4222/tcp (clients), 6222/tcp (cluster routing), 8222/tcp (HTTP monitoring `/healthz`)
- JetStream storage at `/data/jetstream` — mount a persistent volume for durable streams
- Health probe via `/healthz` (orchestrator `httpGet`) — no shell in runtime image
- SHA256-verified binary — no source compilation required

---

## [v0.2.3-alpha] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed

#### Builder slug collision: go-builder and rust-builder now use versioned slugs (`fix(supabase)`)

`go-builder` (v1.24 and v1.25) and `rust-builder` (v1.87) previously used unversioned slugs
(`go-builder`, `go-builder-dev`, `rust-builder`, `rust-builder-dev`), causing all versions of
each family to collapse onto a single DB row. The Hub could not render them as separate version
groups in the catalog list view.

**Fix:** versioned slug scheme — same pattern as `python-builder`:
- `go-builder / "" / v1.24` → `go-builder-v124`
- `go-builder / "dev" / v1.24` → `go-builder-v124-dev`
- `go-builder / "" / v1.25` → `go-builder-v125`
- `go-builder / "dev" / v1.25` → `go-builder-v125-dev`
- `rust-builder / "" / v1.87` → `rust-builder-v187`
- `rust-builder / "dev" / v1.87` → `rust-builder-v187-dev`

`compile` profile suffix is always stripped (maps to no suffix in slug).
Unversioned phantom rows cascade-deleted from Supabase (2026-03-13).
6 re-promote runs confirmed new slugs live in DB and registry.

### Added

#### Pipeline build philosophy documented (`docs(vault)`)

`IMAGE_BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md` added to `.vault/claude/` — comprehensive English-language
reference covering the from-scratch build approach, runtime base selection, static linking
strategy, specialised profiles as independent images, gwshield-init shim behaviour, and the
deliberate absence of Bitnami-style convenience features.

#### `generate-readme.py`: static sections support (`feat(readme)`)

New `--static` CLI argument and `render_pipeline_philosophy()` function in `generate-readme.py`.
Reads an optional `static_sections.json` file from the repo root; injects a **Build philosophy**
section between the builder images table and the hardening principles. Content is authored in
`static_sections.json` — `generate-readme.py` never interpolates dynamic data into it.
Keeps public-facing READMEs in sync with internal philosophy documentation without manual edits.

### Changed

- `scripts/tests/test_supabase_ingress.py`: updated go-builder / rust-builder slug tests for
  versioned scheme; test count: 124 (was 116)
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`: slug table expanded, golden rule (no AI attribution in public
  content) formally documented

---

## [v0.2.2-alpha] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed

#### Hub primary-row rendering for nginx and go-builder (`fix(supabase)`)

The Hub list view groups images by family and renders one image as the "primary" parent row
per version group.  `isPrimaryProfile()` in `images-catalog-view.tsx` recognises `profile=null`
or `profile=standard` as primary.  Three images had canonical profiles that did not match:

| Image slug   | Old profile tag | New profile tag | Effect                              |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `nginx-http`  | `http`          | `standard`      | nginx family now shows parent row   |
| `go-builder`  | `compile`       | `standard`      | v1.25 group now shows parent row    |

`rust-builder` (compile profile) was already correct — no DB change needed.

- **DB patched directly** (delete-first + insert) — takes effect immediately in Hub without
  a re-promote.
- **`supabase_ingress.py` — new `derive_profile_tag()` helper** ensures future re-promotes
  write the correct Hub-facing tag:
  - `nginx` + `""` or `"http"` → `"standard"`
  - `go-builder` / `rust-builder` + `""` or `"compile"` → `"standard"`
  - All other name+profile combinations pass through unchanged.
- **`test_supabase_ingress.py` — new `TestDeriveProfileTag`** — 17 cases covering all
  canonical mappings and passthrough cases; total test count: 116 (was 99).
- No Hub-side code change required — `images-catalog-view.tsx` unchanged.

---

## [v0.2.1-alpha] — 2026-03-12

### Added

#### Supabase `version` tag + `supabase_ingress.py` unit tests (`feat(supabase)`, `test(supabase)`)

- **`version` image tag** written on every promote run — `tag_key='version'`, `tag_value` derived from
  `base_version` via `derive_version_group()`:
  - `major >= 10` → major only (e.g. `v15.17` → `"15"`, `v17.9` → `"17"`)
  - `major < 10`  → `major.minor` (e.g. `v3.12.4` → `"3.12"`, `v1.28.2` → `"1.28"`)
  - Written as delete-first + insert (UNIQUE constraint includes `tag_value` — safe version bump)
  - Wrapped in try/except — Supabase outage never blocks a promote
- **Hub use**: `tag_key='version'` drives sub-grouping in the Hub catalog list view;
  `extractVersionGroup()` in `images-catalog-view.tsx` replaced by direct tag lookup.
- **`scripts/tests/test_supabase_ingress.py`** — new unit test suite for all pure helpers in
  `supabase_ingress.py`; 99 tests, stdlib `unittest` only (no external deps):
  - `TestDeriveVersionGroup` — 18 cases covering all image families + boundary (major 9/10) + no-v-prefix
  - `TestDeriveSlug` — 35 cases covering all slug derivations incl. python-builder dispatch shapes
  - `TestDeriveImageType` / `TestResolveImageType` — 15 cases
  - `TestDeriveOsTag` — 10 cases
  - `TestExtractFindingsFromTrivy` — 6 cases (empty results, None vulns, fixed/unfixed, truncation, PURL)
  - `TestComponentType` — 10 cases
  - `TestMainEnvGuard` — env-var guard exit-code check
- **`promote.yml` pre-flight test step** — `python3 scripts/tests/test_supabase_ingress.py` runs
  immediately after `Set up Python`, before any DB or registry write; no `continue-on-error` — test
  failure hard-stops the promote.

### Fixed

#### `supabase_ingress.py` — python-builder slug derivation (`fix(supabase)`)

Two slug bugs uncovered by the new tests and confirmed in the DB:

1. **`python-builder` canonical profile**: `release-public.yml` dispatches `python-builder:v3.12`
   with `profile=""` (directory name `v3.12` → `base_version=v3.12`, profile stripped to `""`).
   `derive_slug("python-builder", "")` previously returned `"python-builder"` — wrong Hub slug.
   **Fix**: when `profile=""` for `python-builder`, fall back to `base_version` for slug construction:
   `python-builder / "" / v3.12` → `python-builder-v312`.

2. **`python-builder` dev profile**: `release-public.yml` dispatches `python-builder:v3.12-dev`
   with `profile="dev"` (suffix after `base_version` strip). `derive_slug("python-builder", "dev")`
   previously returned `"python-builder-dev"` — missing version segment.
   **Fix**: slug always built from `base_version + optional suffix`:
   `python-builder / "dev" / v3.12` → `python-builder-v312-dev`.

   New derivation logic for python-builder:
   - Normalise `base_version` → `bv_norm` (e.g. `v3.12` → `v312`)
   - Strip any version prefix from `profile` to get pure suffix (`"dev"` stays `"dev"`, `"v3.12"` → `""`)
   - Combine: `python-builder-{bv_norm}` or `python-builder-{bv_norm}-{suffix}`

#### Supabase phantom row cleanup (`fix(supabase)`)

Two phantom image rows accumulated in Supabase from pre-fix promote runs:
- `slug=python-builder` (UUID `a7179fed`) — held versions `v3.12` + `v3.13`, 78 snapshots
- `slug=python-builder-dev` (UUID `2456bdd6`) — held versions `v3.12-dev` + `v3.13-dev`, 79 snapshots

Both rows cascade-deleted (174 rows total across `images`, `image_versions`,
`image_metadata_snapshots`, `image_tags`). The actual OCI images in `ghcr.io/gwshield` are
unaffected — only DB metadata was removed. Final state: 34 active images, 34 version-tags, 0 missing.

---

## [v0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-03-12

### Changed

#### CI pipeline — full stabilisation sprint (`fix(ci)`, `refactor(ci)`, `docs(ci)`)

This release closes the multi-sprint CI stabilisation effort. All 36 images are green, all runners
correctly assigned, no flapping jobs.

**Sprint 1 — Bug fixes (`aa4842a`)**
- `scan.yml` concurrency guard to prevent parallel scan + registry-update races.
- `useblacksmith/*` Actions removed from reusable workflows — replaced with SHA-pinned
  `docker/setup-buildx-action` + `docker/build-push-action` (root cause: Blacksmith runner token
  rejected by GitHub Action-download endpoint for third-party Action tarballs).
- Trivy version pinned; SARIF upload path corrected; `find images -name Dockerfile` depth fixed to
  `-mindepth 3 -maxdepth 4` (was silently dropping all builder images at depth 4).

**Sprint 2+3 — Refactoring (`b79c348`)**
- `ubuntu-latest` → `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404` for 3 additional jobs.
- `scripts/ci/parse-trivy.py` extracted from inline workflow YAML.
- `scripts/ci/discover-targets.sh` extracted from inline workflow YAML.
- `_functional-job.yml` reusable workflow created; `functional.yml` consolidated from per-family
  duplicated jobs to a single parameterised matrix.

**Bugfix sprint — Stability (`d9a9db0` → `81f56fc`)**
- `_functional-job.yml`: `timeout-minutes` hardcoded (expression interpolation not supported at job
  level in reusable workflows); `docker/login-action` SHA-pinned.
- `_functional-job.yml` moved from `.github/workflows/reusable/` to top-level `.github/workflows/`
  — GitHub Actions does not support reusable `workflow_call` files in subdirectories.
- `functional.yml` push-trigger guard job added — GitHub generates a push run when any workflow file
  changes; without an unconditional job the run fails as "0 jobs / workflow file issue".
- `haproxy.sh` + `haproxy-ssl.sh`: SIGPIPE fix — `echo "$VAR" | grep -q` under `set -euo pipefail`
  causes broken-pipe; replaced with herestring `grep -q "pattern" <<< "$VAR"`.
- `haproxy-ssl/configs/haproxy.cfg`: `maxconn` reduced from 50000 → 4096 (50000×2 FDs exceeds CI
  runner FD limit of 65536).
- AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md updated with 4 new CI discoveries (subdirectory constraint,
  `timeout-minutes` interpolation, push-trigger guard pattern, herestring vs pipe).
- Pipeline architecture docs (`.vault/claude/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` + `_EN.md`) fully rewritten
  across 17 sections.

**Runner policy (final state)**
- `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404`: all Docker build jobs.
- `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404`: all other jobs in `RelicFrog/gwshield-images`.
- `ubuntu-latest`: `discover-ci` / `discover-scan-targets` (lightweight, no Docker) + all jobs in
  `gwshield/images` (Blacksmith not installed in that org — permanent documented exception).

---

## [v0.1.9-alpha] — 2026-03-12

### Added

#### Supabase `image_type` propagation — insert-only semantics (`feat(supabase)`)
- **Hub migration 0033** — `images.image_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'service' CHECK (image_type IN
  ('service','builder','tooling'))` — partial indexes on `builder` and `tooling` variants.
- **`supabase_ingress.py`** — `--image-type` CLI parameter on `promote` subcommand (default `'service'`,
  allowed: `service|builder|tooling`, exits non-zero on invalid value).
  - `_VALID_IMAGE_TYPES` constant — matches DB CHECK constraint.
  - `derive_image_type(name, profile)` — auto-detects type from image name/profile.
  - `resolve_image_type(cli_arg, name, profile)` — CLI arg takes priority over auto-detect.
  - `upsert_image()` — SELECT-first, then INSERT (with `image_type`) or UPDATE (without `image_type`);
    admin Hub override survives every subsequent promote run.
- **`release-public.yml`** — `emit_entry()` shell function derives `image_type` from path + profile:
  `images/builders/**` → `builder`; profile `cli` → `tooling`; else → `service`; field added to
  dispatch payload.
- **`promote.yml`** (gwshield/images) — `--image-type "${{ github.event.client_payload.image_type }}"`
  passed to `supabase_ingress.py`.
- **Hub migration 0032** (`images.title_override`, `images.featured_promo_text`) — admin-only fields;
  pipeline never sets or overwrites these.
- Full re-promote of all 36 images triggered to backfill `image_type` in Supabase (2026-03-12).

### Fixed

#### CI pipeline stability — promote.yml (`fix(ci)`)
- **`sigstore/cosign-installer@v3` replaced** with direct `curl` download of cosign v3.0.5 binary
  (SHA256-verified). The `sigstore/cosign-installer` Action caused intermittent `401 Unauthorized`
  during `Set up job` phase on Blacksmith runners — same root cause as the `useblacksmith/*`
  failures fixed in v0.1.8-alpha.
- **`cosign attest` — `continue-on-error: true`** added to SBOM attestation step. Root cause:
  cosign v3 `--replace` reads all existing attestation bundles from the registry before writing;
  bundles created by an earlier cosign version are not valid JSON for cosign v3's envelope parser,
  causing `invalid attestation: decoding json`. On re-promotes (same digest), the SBOM already
  exists and the error is non-fatal. `--replace` flag removed to avoid the fetch.

#### CI pipeline stability — build.yml (`fix(ci)`)
- **`useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1` + `useblacksmith/build-push-action@v2` replaced** with
  SHA-pinned `docker/setup-buildx-action@4d04d5d` (v4.0.0) + `docker/build-push-action@10e90e36`
  (v6.19.2). Root cause: Blacksmith runner token is rejected by GitHub's Action-download endpoint
  for third-party Action tarballs, causing intermittent `401 Unauthorized` on `Set up job`.
  Blacksmith _runners_ are still used — only the Action steps changed.

#### Functional test fixes — haproxy (`fix(tests)`)
- **`haproxy.cfg` `maxconn 50000`** reduced to `4096` — HAProxy requires `maxconn×2` FDs;
  50000 × 2 = 100031 exceeds the CI runner FD limit of 65536, causing immediate container exit.
- **`haproxy.sh` broken pipe** — `$(echo "$METRICS" | head -3)` under `set -o pipefail` causes
  broken-pipe error; fixed by capturing output first, then `{ head -n 3 || true; }`.
- **`haproxy-ssl.sh` broken pipe + HSTS pipe** — same pattern applied; HSTS curl piped to grep
  also fixed.

### Changed

#### Supabase service role key rotation (`chore(infra)`)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` rotated from JWT format (`eyJ...`) to `sb_secret_...` format
  in both `RelicFrog/gwshield-images` and `gwshield/images`.

---

## [v0.1.8-alpha] — 2026-03-12

### Added

#### Go builder v1.25 + v1.25-dev (`feat(builders)`)
- **`images/builders/go-builder/v1.25/Dockerfile`** — hardened compile-only builder image
  on `golang:1.25.8-alpine3.22` (digest-pinned). `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `GOFLAGS=-trimpath`,
  `HISTFILE=/dev/null`, nonroot UID/GID 65532. Identical structure to v1.24.
- **`images/builders/go-builder/v1.25-dev/Dockerfile`** — dev profile extending v1.25 with:
  - `golangci-lint v2.11.3` (updated from v2.11.2 in v1.24-dev)
  - `gofumpt v0.9.2`
  - `goimports` (latest from golang.org/x/tools)
  - `govulncheck v1.1.4`
  - `staticcheck 2026.1` (updated from 2025.1.1 — **requires Go >= 1.25**)
- **Smoke tests**: 7 tests (compile-only) / 12 tests (dev) — same pattern as v1.24
- **Functional tests**: reuse `go-builder.sh` + `go-builder-dev.sh` with v1.25 image tags
- **`functional.yml`**: 2 new matrix entries (`go-builder:v1.25`, `go-builder:v1.25-dev`)
- **CVE scan**: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH — promoted to `ghcr.io/gwshield`

> **Note:** `v1.25-dev` builds after `v1.25` is promoted — the `BASE_DIGEST` in the
> Dockerfile is updated to the live digest after the first promote run.

---

## [v0.1.7-alpha] — 2026-03-11

### Added

#### Caddy v2.11.2 — 5 plugin profiles (`feat(caddy)`)
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2-cloudflare/Dockerfile`** — xcaddy v0.4.5 build with
  `caddy-dns/cloudflare@v0.2.3` (DNS-01 ACME for wildcard certs behind Cloudflare).
  `CF_API_TOKEN` env var required at runtime.
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2-crowdsec/Dockerfile`** — xcaddy build with
  `caddy-crowdsec-bouncer/http@v0.10.0` + `/layer4@v0.10.0` (CrowdSec IP bouncer;
  both sub-packages required for full HTTP + Layer-4 coverage).
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2-security/Dockerfile`** — xcaddy build with
  `caddy-security@v1.1.45` (OIDC/JWT/OAuth2 auth middleware; ~120 transitive deps —
  re-scan on every plugin version bump).
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2-ratelimit/Dockerfile`** — xcaddy build with
  `caddy-ratelimit@v0.1.0` (native in-process rate limiting).
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2-l4/Dockerfile`** — xcaddy build with `caddy-l4@master`
  (Layer-4 / gRPC routing; no versioned releases — pinned to `master`, use commit SHA
  in production).
- All profiles: 4-stage Dockerfile (`deps` → `banner` → `builder` → `scratch`),
  `gwshield-init` banner, 11-test `smoke.sh`, 7-test functional test, 0 CVEs.
- All plugin binaries: `CGO_ENABLED=0` → fully static (zero `NEEDED` entries verified
  via `readelf -d`).
- **xcaddy SHA-512 verified** (`linux_amd64` + `linux_arm64` per `TARGETARCH`) — arch-aware
  download prevents "Invalid ELF image" failure on arm64 QEMU cross-builds.
- **`tests/functional/`** — `caddy-cloudflare.sh`, `caddy-crowdsec.sh`,
  `caddy-security.sh`, `caddy-ratelimit.sh`, `caddy-l4.sh` added (7 tests each).
- **`functional.yml`** — 5 new jobs; `image_group` filter extended.
- **CVE scan**: all 5 profiles — 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH; promoted to `ghcr.io/gwshield`.

### Fixed

#### Caddy plugin profiles — xcaddy arm64 cross-build (`fix(caddy)`)
- xcaddy is a host-native tool binary. Downloading `linux_amd64` and running it under
  QEMU on an `arm64` builder stage fails with "Invalid ELF image for this architecture".
  Fixed by using `ARG TARGETARCH` + `case` statement to select the correct
  `linux_amd64` / `linux_arm64` tarball and its SHA-512 checksum in all 5 plugin
  Dockerfiles.

---

## [v0.1.6-alpha] — 2026-03-11

### Added

#### Caddy v2.11.2 — standard profile (`feat(caddy)`)
- **`images/caddy/v2.11.2/Dockerfile`** — multi-stage build: `golang:1.26.1-alpine3.22` builder
  → `FROM scratch` runtime. `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces a fully static binary with zero dynamic
  dependencies (verified via `readelf -d`).
- **CVE mitigation**: upstream `caddy:2-alpine` (Go 1.26.0) carried 1 CRITICAL (`zlib
  CVE-2026-22184`) and 3 HIGH Go stdlib CVEs (`CVE-2026-25679`, `CVE-2026-27137`,
  `CVE-2026-27142`). Rebuilding with Go 1.26.1 on `FROM scratch` eliminates all four.
- **`configs/Caddyfile`** — automatic HTTPS disabled; HTTP listener on `:8080`; `/healthz`
  returns 200 OK; admin API on `localhost:2019` (healthcheck only, not externally exposed).
- `/data` (`XDG_DATA_HOME`) and `/config` (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) pre-created with UID 65532
  ownership for ACME certificate storage and config cache.
- **`tests/smoke.sh`** — 10 tests: binary, version, config validate, non-root, no-shell, fully
  static (zero NEEDED), CA certs, Caddyfile, /data, /config.
- **`tests/functional/caddy.sh`** — 7 functional tests via Docker network + alpine/curl: /healthz
  200, body OK, 404 for unknown paths, non-root, no version leak in Server header, version string.
- **`functional.yml`** — `functional-caddy` job added; `caddy` image_group filter added.
- **CVE scan**: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH — hard gate passes; image promoted to `ghcr.io/gwshield/caddy:v2.11.2`.

---

## [v0.1.5-alpha] — 2026-03-11

### Added

#### HAProxy v3.1.16 — standard profile (`feat(haproxy)`)
- **`images/haproxy/v3.1.16/Dockerfile`** — Alpine 3.22 builder → FROM scratch runtime;
  static OpenSSL, PCRE2 (JIT), zlib; `USE_PROMEX=1` (Prometheus `/metrics` on `:9101`);
  no Lua (reduced attack surface); only musl libc as shared dependency.
- **musl dynamic loader** copied from builder to `/lib/` in scratch runtime (same pattern
  as Redis/nginx); required for HAProxy binary execution.
- **`configs/haproxy.cfg`** — minimal HTTP frontend (:8080), `/healthz` ACL, stats socket,
  Prometheus metrics frontend (:9101); HAProxy 3.x quirks handled:
  `nbthread` omitted (auto-detect), `master-worker` in CLI (`-W`), `ulimit-n` removed (nonroot).
- **`tests/smoke.sh`** — 8 tests; config syntax check uses exit-code (not string grep —
  HAProxy 3.x no longer prints "Configuration file is valid").
- **`tests/functional/haproxy.sh`** — 7 functional tests via Docker network + alpine/curl sidecar.
- **`functional.yml`** — haproxy job added; `image_group` filter updated.
- **CVE scan**: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH — hard gate passes; image promoted to `ghcr.io/gwshield/haproxy:v3.1.16`.

#### HAProxy v3.1.16-ssl — TLS profile (`feat(haproxy)`)
- **`images/haproxy/v3.1.16-ssl/Dockerfile`** — identical binary to standard; SSL activated at
  config level. `bind *:8443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/server.pem alpn h2,http/1.1`.
- **`configs/haproxy.cfg`** — HTTP :8080 redirects to HTTPS (301), `/healthz` bypasses redirect;
  HTTPS :8443 terminates TLS; HSTS `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`;
  `ssl-min-ver TLSv1.2`; ECDHE+AEAD cipher suites; no deprecated `no-sslv3`/`no-tlsv1x` options.
- `maxconn 32000` — within default container FD limit (65536).
- **`tests/smoke.sh`** — 10 tests; self-signed cert generated for TLS startup test and config check.
- **`tests/functional/haproxy-ssl.sh`** — 7 tests (HTTPS 200, HTTP→HTTPS 301, HSTS, Prometheus, UID).
- **`functional.yml`** — haproxy-ssl job added; `haproxy-ssl` image_group filter added.
- **CVE scan**: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH; promoted to `ghcr.io/gwshield/haproxy:v3.1.16-ssl`.

### Fixed
- `fix(haproxy)`: Dockerfile `COPY configs/haproxy.cfg` path corrected to repo-root-relative
  `images/haproxy/v3.1.16/configs/haproxy.cfg` (build context is repo root).

---

## [v0.1.4-alpha] — 2026-03-11

### Added

#### Structured CVE findings persistence (`feat(supabase)`)
- **`cve_findings` table** (hub migration 0029) — stores per-CVE findings per `image_version_id`;
  unique on `(image_version_id, cve_id)`; fields: `cve_id`, `severity`, `package_name`,
  `package_version`, `fixed_version`, `description`, `layer`, `component`, `mitigation_type`,
  `mitigation_detail`; RLS: public read for public images, service role write.
- **`supabase_ingress.py` — `findings` subcommand** (new, stdlib-only) — parses raw Trivy JSON;
  DiffID-based layer classification (`base_image` | `builder_stage`); component taxonomy
  (`alpine-pkg`, `debian-pkg`, `rust-crate`, `go-module`, `python-pkg`, `npm-pkg`, `other`);
  `mitigation_type` derived from `FixedVersion` presence (`pkg_upgrade` / `not_applicable`);
  upsert on `(image_version_id, cve_id)` — fully idempotent.
- **`promote.yml`** (gwshield/images) — new "Write CVE findings to Supabase" step after
  `registry.json` update; passes Trivy output as `--findings-json`; `continue-on-error: true`.
- **`scan.yml`** (RelicFrog/gwshield-images) — `update-public-registry` job extended to pass
  `--findings-json @trivy-scan.json` on every weekly re-scan; findings stay current.
- **`cve-rescan-origin.yml`** (RelicFrog/gwshield-images) — new backfill + weekly rescan
  pipeline; reads `registry.json` from `gwshield/images`, pulls each image by digest, runs
  Trivy at full severity (`CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW`), writes structured findings; `max-parallel: 4`;
  `continue-on-error: true` per job; weekly schedule Sunday 05:00 UTC; manual dispatch with
  `image_filter` input.
- **Backfill complete** (2026-03-11): 27/27 images rescanned → **132 rows** written to
  `cve_findings`; breakdown: HIGH 12, MEDIUM 23, LOW 97; all `layer=base_image`; 0 CRITICAL
  (hard gate holds); `debian-pkg` dominant (120/132) from distroless PostgreSQL base.

#### gwshield-hub — community catalog live (`feat(hub)`)
- **`hub.gwshield.io`** launched — Next.js 16 + Supabase + GitHub OAuth + Netlify; Phases A–D
  complete as of 2026-03-10. Companion repo: `520-app-gwshield-hub-public`.
- All 23 pipeline images visible in the public catalog (`/images`); data sourced via
  `supabase_ingress.py` after every promote and scan run.
- **Image request system** live at `/requests` — community can submit, vote, and comment on
  image targets; admin moderation queue at `/admin/requests`; `priority_score` Postgres trigger.
- **Changelog page** (`/changelog`) — promotion timeline sourced from `promotion_runs` table.
- **Admin area** — request moderation, featured-image toggle, immutable audit log;
  role-gated by `app_metadata.role` in Supabase Auth JWT.
- **Supabase schema** — migrations 0001–0029 applied; pipeline-relevant additions:
  `cosign_identity`, `base_version`, `profile` on `image_versions`; `scan_status`, `scanner`
  on `image_metadata_snapshots`; `cve_findings` table (migration 0029).

#### Supabase writeback — fully operational (`feat(supabase)`)
- `supabase_ingress.py` (stdlib-only) in `gwshield/images/scripts/` — `promote`, `scan`, and
  `findings` subcommands; idempotent upsert; slug derivation matches hub seed catalog.
- All 23 image/version/snapshot/findings records confirmed written.

#### Pipeline hardening (`fix(ci)`)
- `release-public.yml` — dispatch-verify step polls 4×15s for confirmed `promote` run start;
  fails after 60s if no run detected (catches silent `gwshield-builder` App permission gaps).
- `ci.yml` — workflow YAML syntax validation via `yaml.safe_load()` on all `*.yml` files.
- `functional.yml` — 3× retry with 10s backoff on all `docker pull` steps.
- `gwshield-builder` App — `actions:write` permission added (required for
  `repository_dispatch` to trigger workflows in `gwshield/images`).

#### Runner migration — all workflows on Blacksmith (`ci(workflows)`)
- **`ubuntu-latest` eliminated** from all 6 workflows in `RelicFrog/gwshield-images`.
- GitHub Free minutes no longer consumed by any CI run.

#### Functional test fixes (`fix(tests)`)
- `nginx.sh` — `fastcgi_temp_path` directive removed from test nginx config.
- `python-builder-dev.sh` — `setuptools.build_meta` backend; `EXPECTED_MINOR` unused var removed.
- `go-builder-dev.sh` — golangci-lint assertion corrected (no false positive on file:line:col).
- `postgres.sh` — `max-parallel` reduced to 2 (OOM guard for initdb in constrained CI).

#### Rust builder images (`feat(builders)`)
- **Rust builder v1.87 (compile-only)** (`images/builders/rust-builder/v1.87/`) —
  based on `rust:1.87.0-alpine3.22` (digest-pinned), nonroot UID 65532, `CARGO_HOME` owned
  by nonroot, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target pre-installed alongside the default
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static"` produces fully
  static musl binaries; 0 CVEs (after targeted `apk upgrade`); smoke tested; published to
  `ghcr.io/gwshield/rust-builder:v1.87`.
- **Rust builder v1.87-dev** (`images/builders/rust-builder/v1.87-dev/`) — extends v1.87 with
  `clippy` and `rustfmt` (rustup components) plus `cargo-audit v0.21.2` and `cargo-deny v0.18.2`
  (compiled from source via `cargo install --locked`); 0 CVEs; smoke tested; published to
  `ghcr.io/gwshield/rust-builder:v1.87-dev`.
- **Rust functional tests** — `tests/functional/rust-builder.sh` and `rust-builder-dev.sh` covering
  static binary compilation, musl target verification, clippy, rustfmt, cargo-audit, cargo-deny;
  `tests/functional/fixtures/rust-app/` (Cargo.toml + deny.toml + src/main.rs + src/lib.rs);
  `functional.yml` matrix entries added for the `rust` image group.

### Fixed

#### CVE remediation — Rust v1.87 base (`fix(builders)`)
- `rust:1.87.0-alpine3.22` shipped with outdated Alpine packages containing 8 HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs:
  - `binutils 2.44-r0` → `2.44-r3`: CVE-2025-5244, CVE-2025-5245 (HIGH)
  - `libcrypto3`/`libssl3 3.5.0-r0` → `3.5.5-r0`: CVE-2025-15467 (CRITICAL),
    CVE-2025-69419, CVE-2025-69421 (HIGH)
- Fixed via targeted `apk upgrade --no-cache binutils libssl3 libcrypto3` in the builder stage.
  Allowlist entries document the remediation; to be removed when upstream Rust base image ships
  the fixed packages.

#### Smoke test — v1.87 cargo build test (`fix(tests)`)
- Replaced `docker create` + `docker start` + `docker cp` pattern with a single `docker run --rm`
  that performs the full build, binary execution, and `readelf` static check inside the container.
  The original approach failed because `RUSTFLAGS` inside a quoted `sh -c` string was not seen
  by cargo; moving to `-e RUSTFLAGS=...` env var and eliminating the docker cp step resolved the
  failure. Pattern now mirrors the working `v1.87-dev` smoke test approach.

---

## [v0.1.3-alpha] — 2026-03-08

### Added

#### Builder images — Go + Python (`feat(builders)`)
- **Go builder v1.24 (compile-only)** (`images/builders/go-builder/v1.24/`) — Alpine 3.22 base,
  `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`, `GOFLAGS`, nonroot UID 65532; smoke tested; 0 CVEs; published
  to `ghcr.io/gwshield/go-builder:v1.24`.
- **Go builder v1.24-dev** (`images/builders/go-builder/v1.24-dev/`) — extends v1.24 with full
  dev tooling: golangci-lint v2.11.2, gofumpt v0.9.2, goimports, govulncheck v1.1.4,
  staticcheck 2025.1.1; installed via official binary releases / `go install`; smoke tested;
  0 CVEs; published to `ghcr.io/gwshield/go-builder:v1.24-dev`.
- **Python builder v3.12 + v3.13 (compile-only)** (`images/builders/python-builder/v3.12/`,
  `v3.13/`) — Alpine base, UV + pip, nonroot UID 65532; smoke tested; 0 CVEs.
- **Python builder v3.12-dev + v3.13-dev** — extends compile-only with: ruff, mypy, pytest,
  pip-audit, black, isort; smoke tested; 0 CVEs; published to `ghcr.io/gwshield`.

#### PostgreSQL v17.9 — full profile stack (`feat(images)`)
- **PostgreSQL v17.9 (standard, tls, cli, vector, timescale)** (`images/postgres/v17.9*/`) —
  full port of the v15.17 profile stack to PostgreSQL 17.9. New build requirements for PG17:
  `bison`, `flex`, and `perl` (for `Gen_fmgrtab.pl`, `gen_node_support.pl`, `genbki.pl`);
  SHA-256 verified source tarball; distroless/cc-debian12 runtime; 0 CVEs on all 5 profiles.
  Extensions: pg_partman v5.4.3, pg_cron v1.6.7, pgvector v0.8.2, TimescaleDB v2.25.2.
  All 5 profiles published to `ghcr.io/gwshield/postgres:v17.9[-profile]`.

#### Functional test suite (`feat(tests)`)
- **`tests/functional/`** — Level 1 functional tests for every image group; test real
  operational behaviour beyond the existing smoke tests (container lifecycle + minimal function):
  - `go-builder.sh` — multi-package compile, `go test`, static binary extraction + `file(1)` check
  - `go-builder-dev.sh` — golangci-lint, gofumpt, govulncheck, staticcheck, goimports on fixture
  - `python-builder.sh` — `pip install`, module execution, output verification
  - `python-builder-dev.sh` — ruff, mypy, pytest, black, pip-audit on fixture
  - `postgres.sh` — initdb, `pg_isready`, `CREATE TABLE` + `INSERT` + `SELECT` round-trip,
    extension-load check (profile-specific: vector, timescale, cli)
  - `redis.sh` — PING, `SET`/`GET`, TTL, `INFO server`, cluster-enabled check
  - `nginx.sh` — HTTP 200 on `/healthz`, static file content, `server_tokens off` header check
  - `traefik.sh` — `/ping` 200, API `/api/rawdata`, web entrypoint, `/api/version` JSON
- **`tests/functional/fixtures/`** — shared Go (`go-app/`) and Python (`python-app/`) fixture
  packages used by builder functional tests.
- **`.github/workflows/functional.yml`** — daily cron at 03:00 UTC against published
  `ghcr.io/gwshield` images; manual dispatch with `image_group` filter
  (`all | builders | postgres | redis | nginx | traefik`); `fail-fast: false` matrix.

#### Public README improvements (`feat(readme)`)
- **Version column** added to all image tables in `gwshield/images` README (rendered by
  `generate-readme.py`); makes the software version explicit alongside the full image tag.
- **WIP / early-access banner** added to the header section — announces alpha status,
  upcoming gwshield.io landing page, MCP server, and extended tooling.

### Fixed

#### CI lint (`fix(images)`)
- `go-builder/v1.24-dev/Dockerfile` — `# hadolint ignore=DL3002` before `USER 0` in
  `tool-installer` stage; `# hadolint ignore=DL3062` before `RUN` block that uses
  `go install goimports@latest` (no standalone release tag for `golang.org/x/tools`).
- `python-builder/v3.12-dev/Dockerfile` and `python-builder/v3.13-dev/Dockerfile` —
  `# hadolint ignore=DL3002` before `USER 0` in `tool-installer` stage.

#### Smoke tests — distroless-safe `.so` checks (`fix(images)`)
- `images/postgres/v17.9-vector/tests/smoke.sh` — replaced `docker run --entrypoint /bin/ls`
  (unavailable in distroless) with `_file_in_image` helper (`docker create` + `cp`);
  added Tests 6 + 7 for `pg_partman.control` and `pg_cron.so` presence (aligned with v15.17-vector).
- `images/postgres/v17.9-timescale/tests/smoke.sh` — same fix + added `_file_pattern_in_image`
  helper for `timescaledb-tsl` versioned filename; aligned 11-test suite with v15.17-timescale.

---

## [v0.1.2-alpha] — 2026-03-08

### Added

#### Cross-org public promotion pipeline (`feat(ci)`)
- **`release-public.yml`** refactored from direct promote to `repository_dispatch` fan-out:
  dispatches per-image promote events to `gwshield/images`; no credentials flow in the payload;
  `gwshield/images` generates its own tokens per job.
- **`gwshield/images` promote workflow** (`gwshield/images/.github/workflows/promote.yml`):
  receives `promote-image` dispatch; runs skopeo copy, cosign keyless sign, syft SBOM attestation;
  writes `registry.json` entry; triggers `readme-update` dispatch.
- **GitHub App `gwshield-builder`** (App ID `3032134`): installed in both `relicfrog` and
  `gwshield` orgs; permissions: `packages:write`, `contents:write`, `members:read`, `metadata:read`;
  used for cross-org dispatch auth only — src/dst image operations use `GITHUB_TOKEN` and
  `RELICFROG_READ_PAT` respectively.
- **`RELICFROG_READ_PAT`** (classic PAT, `read:packages` only): stored in `gwshield/images`;
  sole mechanism that works for cross-org GHCR src pull — fine-grained PATs and App tokens are
  denied by GHCR for org-owned packages. Expires ~2027-03, calendar reminder set.
- **`ghcr-cleanup.yml`** — weekly orphaned manifest pruning (Sunday 03:00 UTC); auto-discovery
  of all gwshield GHCR packages; dry-run mode; no extra PAT needed.

#### registry.json processing engine (`feat(registry)`)
- **`gwshield/images/scripts/update-registry.py`** — single source of truth for all public image
  metadata; `promote` subcommand (upsert after each promote), `scan` subcommand (CVE status update
  after each trivy run); idempotent upsert keyed by `name:version`; schema version `"1"`.
- **`registry.json`** (in `gwshield/images`) — auto-generated, never edited manually; fields per
  image entry: `name`, `version`, `base_version`, `profile`, `public_image`, `tags`, `digest`,
  `cosign_identity`, `promoted_at`, `scan.{status,total,critical,high,scanner,scanned_at}`.
- **`gwshield/images/scripts/generate-readme.py`** — renders `README.md` from `registry.json`;
  groups images by service; per-image table with tag, profile, short digest, CVE status, promote
  date; `cosign verify` section per image; graceful placeholder if `registry.json` missing.
- **`gwshield/images/.github/workflows/readme-update.yml`** — triggered by `registry-updated`
  repository_dispatch (from promote and scan jobs) and manual dispatch; pulls latest commits after
  checkout (race-condition guard); regenerates README; commits `[skip ci]`; concurrency-queued
  (never drops updates).

#### scan.yml — public registry CVE status sync (`feat(ci)`)
- New `update-public-registry` matrix job after `trivy-scan`: downloads per-image scan artifact,
  parses CVE counts (total, critical, high), dispatches `registry-updated` event to
  `gwshield/images` with CVE payload; uses App token for gwshield dispatch auth.

#### PostgreSQL v15.17 — two new flavor profiles (`feat(postgres)`)
- **vector** (`images/postgres/v15.17-vector/`) — PostgreSQL 15.17 + pgvector v0.8.2 +
  pg_partman v5.4.2 + pg_cron v1.6.7; pgvector compiled via `USE_PGXS=1`, produces `vector.so`;
  activated per-DB via `CREATE EXTENSION vector;` (no `shared_preload_libraries` entry needed);
  adds VECTOR data type, IVFFlat and HNSW index types; same distroless/cc-debian12 runtime.
- **timescale** (`images/postgres/v15.17-timescale/`) — PostgreSQL 15.17 + TimescaleDB v2.25.1 +
  pg_partman v5.4.2 + pg_cron v1.6.7; TimescaleDB built via CMake (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`,
  `-DREGRESS_CHECKS=OFF`); installs `timescaledb.so` + `timescaledb-tsl.so`; MUST be first in
  `shared_preload_libraries`; `timescaledb.telemetry_level = off`; TSL license noted in
  `docs/risk-statement.md`.
- Both profiles inherit pg_partman + pg_cron from standard profile.

### Changed

#### PostgreSQL v15.17 standard profile — extensions added (`feat(postgres)`)
- Added pg_partman v5.4.2 and pg_cron v1.6.7 to the v15.17 standard profile; two new builder
  stages (`ext-partman`, `ext-cron`); `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron,pg_partman_bgw'`.

#### PostgreSQL v15.13 → v15.17 patch update (`chore(postgres)`)
- Bumped source tarball from 15.13 to 15.17; updated SHA256 pin; renamed image directories.

### Removed

#### `release.yml` retired (`chore(ci)`)
- Removed `.github/workflows/release.yml` — traefik-only, old naming convention, superseded by
  the cross-org `release-public.yml` + `gwshield/images/promote.yml` architecture.

### Security

#### App visibility review (`docs(security)`)
- `gwshield-builder` App cannot be set private (GitHub constraint: app installed on multiple orgs).
- Confirmed non-issue: installation tokens are scoped per-org — external installations have zero
  access to `relicfrog` or `gwshield` resources.
- Documented in `.vault/claude/CROSS_ORG_CI_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## [v0.1.1-alpha] — 2026-03-01

### Added

#### Redis v7.4.8 — three hardened profiles (`feat(redis)`)
- **standard** (`images/redis/v7.4.8/`) — Redis built from source with `DISABLE_SCRIPTING=yes`;
  `libm` statically linked via `LDFLAGS="-Wl,-Bstatic -lm -Wl,-Bdynamic"`; FROM scratch runtime;
  dangerous commands renamed in `redis.conf`; `protected-mode no` for container deployments.
- **TLS** (`images/redis/v7.4.8-tls/`) — OpenSSL statically linked via `LIBSSL_LIBS` and
  `LIBCRYPTO_LIBS` make variables (not `LDFLAGS`); TLS-only listener on port 6380; plain port
  disabled; self-signed cert and key included for smoke tests.
- **cluster-mode** (`images/redis/v7.4.8-cluster/`) — same binary as standard; cluster mode
  is a config-level feature enabled via `cluster-enabled yes` and
  `cluster-config-file /data/nodes.conf`; smoke test verifies `redis_mode:cluster` via
  `INFO server`.
- All three profiles: FROM scratch runtime, UID/GID 65532, musl loader verification step in
  builder, docker-network smoke tests, `scan/allowlist.yaml`, `docs/` risk statement and
  mitigation summary.

#### nginx v1.28.2 — three hardened profiles (`feat(nginx)`)
- **http** (`images/nginx/v1.28.2/`) — nginx built from source; pcre2, zlib statically linked;
  FROM scratch runtime; stripped modules list.
- **http2** (`images/nginx/v1.28.2-http2/`) — same as http with `--with-http_v2_module`.
- **http3 / QUIC** (`images/nginx/v1.28.2-http3/`) — built against
  **QuicTLS** (`openssl-3.3.0-quic1`), which is the correct OpenSSL fork for QUIC (BoringSSL
  is incompatible with nginx's `--with-openssl=<path>` pattern); pcre2 and zlib statically
  linked via `--with-ld-opt="-Wl,-Bstatic -lpcre2-8 -lz -Wl,-Bdynamic"`.

#### Shared C/autoconf builder snippet (`feat(shared)`)
- `shared/builders/c-autoconf/Dockerfile.builder` — reusable builder stage template for
  images that compile C sources via autoconf/make.
- `shared/builders/c-autoconf/versions.env.template` — version-pin template for C/autoconf targets.

### Fixed

#### CI — push-event target discovery (`fix(ci)`)
- `build.yml` and `ci.yml`: switched from `origin/main...HEAD` to `HEAD~1..HEAD` for diff-based
  auto-discovery of changed image directories on push events. Prevents missing targets when
  history is shallow-cloned.
- Guard `grep` against exit code 1 when diff produces no image changes (empty matrix).

#### nginx — static linking corrections (`fix(nginx)`)
- Switched http3 from BoringSSL to QuicTLS — BoringSSL has no `./config` script and is
  incompatible with nginx's `--with-openssl=<path>` argument.
- Corrected `--with-ld-opt` for pcre2+zlib static linking — without these flags the FROM scratch
  runtime has no `.so` files and the binary fails to start.
- Resolved `SC2034` shellcheck warnings (unused variables `uid`, `i`) in `smoke.sh`.
- Replaced `cd + clone` pattern with direct `git clone` into `WORKDIR` to satisfy `DL3003`.

#### Build performance — BuildKit cache mounts (`perf(build)`)
- Added `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apk,id=apk-<name>-<profile>-<stage>` to all
  Alpine `apk add` steps across all images — enables Blacksmith sticky disk cache reuse.

### Changed
- Version bump: `v0.1.0-alpha` → `v0.1.1-alpha`.
- Digest verification dates updated to 2026-03-01 for all targets.
- musl loader grep filter standardised to `'musl'` (matches both `ld-musl-*.so.1` and
  `libc.musl-*.so.1`) across all images.

---

## [v0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Traefik v3.6.9 — initial hardened image (`feat(traefik)`)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: deps stage (Alpine 3.23), builder stage (Go 1.25.7-alpine3.23),
  runtime stage (FROM scratch).
- Binary rebuilt from source with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; verified statically linked via
  `readelf -d`.
- Non-root runtime: UID/GID 65532 (`nonroot`).
- `scan/allowlist.yaml` — confirmed false positive documented (CVE-2026-24051,
  Darwin-only code path, not compiled on linux/amd64).
- `docs/risk-statement.md` and `docs/mitigation-summary.md`.
- Smoke tests: startup, `--help`, non-root assertion, no-shell assertion, `/ping` endpoint.

#### Mono-repo MVP architecture (`feat(arch)`)
- `images/<name>/<version>/` layout — self-contained per image target.
- `shared/base-layers/` — reference Dockerfile patterns (nonroot user, ca-certs, tzdata).
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — matrix build + push to GHCR + CVE scan + smoke; uses
  Blacksmith (`useblacksmith/setup-docker-builder@v1`, `useblacksmith/build-push-action@v2`);
  auto-discovery via `find images -name Dockerfile`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR/branch lint (hadolint, shellcheck, YAML schema) + local
  build + smoke; auto-discovery via changed file diff.
- `.github/workflows/scan.yml` — weekly scheduled re-scan (Trivy + Grype); opens GitHub
  issue on new findings.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — semver tag gate: scan must pass → cosign sign →
  GitHub Release.
- `renovate.json` — automated PRs for Go toolchain, Alpine base image, and service version bumps.
- `Makefile` — local dev shortcuts: `build`, `scan`, `smoke`, `all`, `list`, `pipeline-debug`.

#### Documentation
- `README.md` — project overview, image catalogue, quickstart, security model, CI/CD overview.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — per-image contract, Dockerfile conventions, PR checklist.
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting policy.
- `STRUCTURE.md` — repository layout and pipeline flow.
- `AGENTS.md` — agent roles, conventions, guardrails.
- `CLAUDE.md` — problem statement, work tracks, non-negotiables.

### Fixed
- SARIF upload removed — requires GitHub Advanced Security licence (not available for private
  repo without licence).
- Lowercase registry org (`relicfrog`) hardcoded — `github.repository_owner` returns
  mixed-case on GHCR pushes.
- `hadolint DL4006` warning resolved in Traefik Dockerfile.
- `shellcheck SC2034` and `SC2155` warnings resolved across smoke scripts.

# Gatewarden Shield — Hardened Container Images

Zero-CVE, production-hardened container images. Built from source, signed with
cosign, SBOM attached. All images run as non-root (UID 65532) with no shell,
no package manager, and no network utilities in the runtime layer.

> The source build pipeline is private. This registry is the public distribution
> endpoint. Every image is built from upstream source tarballs with SHA-256
> verification, scanned with Trivy and Grype before promotion, and cosign-signed
> with a keyless Sigstore OIDC identity.

## Available images

### PostgreSQL — relational database

| Tag | Profile | Digest | CVE status | Promoted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/gwshield/postgres:v15.17-timescale` | TimescaleDB | `a5c11f824ae8` | not scanned | 2026-03-08 |

## Hardening principles

- Built from upstream source tarballs with SHA-256 verification
- Multi-stage builds — `FROM scratch` or distroless runtime layer
- No shell, no package manager, no `curl`/`wget` in the runtime layer
- Non-root execution: UID/GID 65532
- Hardened compiler flags: `-fstack-protector-strong`, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, RELRO, NOW
- Trivy + Grype CVE scan gate — 0 unfixed HIGH/CRITICAL findings at release time
- cosign keyless signed (Sigstore / OIDC) — no long-lived key material
- SBOM attached to OCI manifest (CycloneDX + SPDX)
